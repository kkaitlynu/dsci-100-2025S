    "Minecraft, developed by Mojang Studios and released in 2011, is a 3D sandbox video game in which players can freely explore, build, and interact with the virtual environment in a world composed of blocks and entities. At the University of British Columbia, a research group in the Department Computer Science led by Frank Wood has created a Minecraft server to collect data on player behaviour.\n",
    "Understanding player activity patterns is vital for effective server management. Since servers are often limited by their resources, the research team must be able to predict periods of high demand to ensure a smooth player experience. Using historical session data, this project aims to identify the times of day when player activity is at its highest.\n",
    "\n",
    "The question we aim to answer in this report is: *can the **hour of day** predict the number of concurrent active players on the Minecraft research server, based on play session data?* The response variable in this analysis is the number of concurrent active players, aggregated by hour. The primary explanatory variable we focus on is hour of day. Other potential variables for future research could include day of week (e.g. whether it is a weekend), month, or season. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used in this analysis, **sessions.csv**, contains 1535 rows and 5 columns containing player session information on the Minecraft research server. Each row indicates a single play session with the following variables.\n",

    "The dataset, collected via server logs, spans several months of server activity, with session lengths varying from a few minutes to multiple hours. As player data is anonymized, this dataset may be limited to a certain demographic, thus misrepresenting the target population. Furthermore, overlapping sessions, or those that cross hourly or daily boundaries require careful analysis in order to produce accurate player counts.\n"
