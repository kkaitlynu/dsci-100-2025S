    "Minecraft, developed by Mojang Studios and released in 2011, is a 3D sandbox video game in which players can freely explore, build, and interact with the virtual environment in a world composed of blocks and entities [1]. At the University of British Columbia, a research group in the Department Computer Science led by Frank Wood has created a Minecraft server to collect data on player behaviour.\n",

Since servers are often limited by their resources, the research team must be able to predict periods of high demand to ensure a smooth player experience.

    "        1. key assumptions of bootstrapping: we must assume that the data is a representative sample - sessions span range of dates and hours for natural variability. We will treat each row as an independent unit that can be resampled, and we are estimating a statistic - mean/median number of concurrent players per hour, so the sample size is large enough for the bootstrap distribution to estimate the true sampling distribution\n",
    "        2. limitations: dataset isn’t from random sampling/sessions may not be independent since the same user can play multiple times, dataset may also not be perfectly representative; bootstrapping doesn't perfectly portray future trends, only uncertainty estimates; also only focusing on hour of day, so results may not be nuanced enough\n",
