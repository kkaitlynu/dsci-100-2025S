    "- Background: provide some relevant background information on the topic so that someone unfamiliar with it will be prepared to understand the rest of your report\n",
    "- Question(s): clearly state the question you tried to answer with your project. Your question should involve one response variable of interest and one or more explanatory variables, and should be stated as a question. One common question format is: “Can [explanatory variable(s)] predict [response variable] in [dataset]?”, but you are free to format your question as you choose so long as it is clear.\n",
    "- Data Description: identify and fully describe the dataset that was used to answer the question. Provide a full descriptive summary of the dataset, including information such as the number of observations, summary statistics, number of variables, name and type of variables, what the variables mean, any issues you see in the data, any other potential issues related to things you cannot directly see, how the data were collected, etc. Make sure to use bullet point lists or tables to summarize the variables in an easy-to-understand format. Note that the selected dataset(s) will probably contain more variables than you need."
