    "Minecraft, developed by Mojang Studios and released in 2011, is a 3D sandbox video game in which players can freely explore, build, and interact with the virtual environment in a world composed of blocks and entities [1]. At the University of British Columbia, a research group in the Department Computer Science led by Frank Wood has created a Minecraft server to collect data on player behaviour.\n",
    "Understanding player activity patterns is vital for effective server management. Since servers are often limited by their resources, the research team must be able to predict periods of high demand to ensure a smooth player experience. Using historical session data, this project aims to identify the times of day when player activity is at its highest."

    "    1. why bootstrapping is appropriate → summarizing average hourly traffic, can give confidence intervals on averages without making strong assumptions, since we’re estimating means/medians and their uncertainty- we can make the assumption that this dataset is a single sample from a greater population and that based on the CIs that we get from this analysis, we can use it to predict how a larger population would behave (representative sample); bootstrapping resamples data directly and lets us estimate uncertainty without relying on assumptions about distribution\n",
    "    2. estimating mean concurrent players per hour -> choose bootstrapping since we aren't clustering or trying to predict a new category; no complex model assumptions. therefore, using cross-validation is unnecessary. \n",
    "        1. key assumptions of bootstrapping: we must assume that the data is a representative sample - sessions span range of dates and hours for natural variability. We will treat each row as an independent unit that can be resampled, and we are estimating a statistic - mean/median number of concurrent players per hour, so the sample size is large enough for the bootstrap distribution to estimate the true sampling distribution\n",
    "        2. limitations: dataset isn’t from random sampling/sessions may not be independent since the same user can play multiple times, dataset may also not be perfectly representative; bootstrapping doesn't perfectly portray future trends, only uncertainty estimates; also only focusing on hour of day, so results may not be nuanced enough\n",
    "        4. used 95% CI to estimate the range of average concurrent players for the busiest hours \n",
    "5. submit as .pdf which includes a link to github repo and an .ipynb file that is fully reproducible and runs from top to bottom without additional files"
